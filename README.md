# CSE
I am a freshmen at Liberty High School, Wentzville School District and I am taking PLTW Computer Science Essentials. I have a lot of programming experience. I know a lot of block-based programming and some Python programming. I am currently learning Python. I have uploaded all my python projects, programs, and docs to my GitHub Repository
